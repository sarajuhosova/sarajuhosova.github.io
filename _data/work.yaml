# - title: How We Use Interactive Theorem Provers
#   year: 2025
#   abstract: |
#     <b>Join an (online) interview to help us determine how we use interactive theorem provers!</b> <br>
#     <br>
#     <b>What?</b> 90 - 120 minute interviews (possibly including a small think-aloud programming session) <br>
#     <b>When?</b> interviews will be scheduled starting September 2024 <br>
#     <b>Where?</b> online (participants from anywhere are welcome) <br>
#     <b>Who?</b> anyone who uses or has used an interactive theorem prover for whatever purpose <br>
#     <br>
#     We are hoping these interviews will help us determine how you interact with your theorem provers and to gain insights on how we can improve the user experience.
#     We are interested in all aspects of interactive theorem provers, including but not limited to their design, their tooling, their libraries, and their documentation. <br>

- title: How Novices Perceive Interactive Theorem Provers
  year: 2024
  abstract: |
    Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are known to have a steep learning curve and poor usability.
    This hinders their spread into commercial software development, wasting their potential to improve software quality.
    To understand what makes them inaccessible to novices, we conducted an online survey among bachelor students, asking them to list the obstacles they encountered while learning Agda.
    Analysis of the results revealed design choices and tool deficiencies which do not provide an adequate level of support to beginner nor advanced users.
    These observations point to one prominent point of improvement: providing a more accessible and sturdy infrastructure for ITP programmers.
