        This book is probably my all-time favourite.
        I picked it up not knowing what to expect and was positively surprised in every aspect.
        The story, the characters, and the style of writing are delightful.
        Though there are plenty of small details to consume, the story keeps advancing and the pacing is perfect.
        I loved how the story felt like something that could actually happen in our world.
        Last but not least, this might be the only book that's actually made me laugh out loud at multiple occasions.

        I did not grow up playing video games and this was the first I ever started, enjoyed, and played through completely.
        The art is beautiful, the story is captivating, and the gameplay is fun (albeit difficult for someone who does not know how to operate a controller).
