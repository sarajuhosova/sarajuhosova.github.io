        Usually, I hate any kind of element of luck in a board game, but the way it's incorporated in Clank! makes me forgive it.
        The premise of this game is that you are a thief trying to steal treasures from a dragon's lair.
        Certain actions make you Clank!, generating noise, and making it more likely that the dragon will harm you in its next attack.
        This game really feels like a video game brought on the table, and it made me love deck-building as a mechanic.

        The one game where we <em>all</em> passionately play to win (trash talking is common).

        Just as great (if not better) than the first one.
        The art of these games is just breathtaking.

        This book is probably my all-time favourite.
        I picked it up not knowing what to expect and was positively surprised in every aspect.
        The story, the characters, and the style of writing are delightful.
        Though there are plenty of small details to consume, the story keeps advancing and the pacing is perfect.
        I loved how the story felt like something that could actually happen in our world.
        Last but not least, this might be the only book that's actually made me laugh out loud at multiple occasions.

        This game has the perfect amount of resource competition - just enough to keep it interesting, but not enough to make you nervous.
        With great mechanics, ideal playtime, and a cool topic, this is probably our most played game.
        The only complaint I have about this game is the component quality - and you can fix that by buying the <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/311247/terraforming-mars-big-box">Terraforming Mars: Big Box</a>.

        I did not grow up playing video games, and this was the first I ever started, enjoyed, and played one through completely.
        The art is beautiful, the story is captivating, and the gameplay is fun (albeit quite difficult for someone who does not know how to operate a controller).
