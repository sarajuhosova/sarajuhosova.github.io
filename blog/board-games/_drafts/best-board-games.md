Over the past few years, I've amassed a [collection of board and card games](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/sarantja?sort=rank&sortdir=asc&rankobjecttype=subtype&rankobjectid=1&columns=title%7Cthumbnail%7Crank%7Crating%7Cbggrating%7Ccomment%7Ccommands&geekranks=Board%20Game%20Rank&objecttype=thing&ff=1&subtype=boardgame).
This post goes over my favourites in a variety of categories, ranging from complex strategy games such as [Terraforming Mars](#-best-strategic-game-terraforming-mars) to "simple" classics such as [UNO](#1Ô∏è‚É£-best-card-game-uno).
Sit back and enjoy!

The OG friendship-ruining game, UNO is perfect for evenings with friends.

There is, of course, only one correct way to play it, called "Olympic UNO".
It is played over multiple rounds of UNO games and works the following way:
* *Everyone starts with 5 cards.*
  Each time you lose a round, you start all following ones with one card less.
* *There are no winners, only an ultimate loser.*
  All rounds are played until the last man standing.
  If you have no more cards to start with, you become the ultimate loser.
  The Olympic game ends - no more rounds are played.
* *The most recent loser shuffles and deals, and they start the next round.*
  
Other rules include:
1. The effects of the starting card are ignored - it only indicates the colour / symbol that can be played.
2. If the starting card is black, the card at the bottom of the drawing pile indicates the starting colour.
3. You may finish with a special card.
4. If you have multiple cards of the same symbol in your hand, you may play them at the same time.
5. If you cannot play a card and must draw, you may play the card immediately if it can be played.
   If you have another card with that symbol in your hand, you may add it immediately!
6. You may play a `skip` card to propagate your own skip onto the next player.
   In case a player plays X `skip` cards at once, the following X players are skipped.
   The skipped players can all play their own Y `skip` cards, and propagate them to the Y players after the originally skipped players.
   Yes, you can even skip yourself this way.
7. You may play any number of `+2` cards to propagate any `+2`s played at you.
8. You may play any number of `+4` cards to propagate any `+2`s and `+4`s played at you.
9. You may play any number of `+2` cards to propagate any `+4`s played at you *only if* the first `+2` matches the colour chosen by the player who played the `+4`.
10. If you have to draw cards due to a `+2` or `+4`, your turn is skipped.
11. You can be brought back into the game after placing your last card in two cases:
    1. If you are part of a `+2` / `+4` chain that loops back to you.
       In this case, you have to draw all of those cards.
    2. If there are two players left, and it is the other player's turn (so not if they are skipped, but yes if they skip you back).
       In this case, the other player may play a `+2` or `+4`, and you must draw those cards.

## üÉè Best [French-suited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French-suited_playing_cards) Card Game: Americk√Ω ≈Ωol√≠k (Rummy)

A game I learned to play with my grandma and the go-to small game of my family, this version of rummy has the following rules:
1. Deal 5 cards to each player.
2. Each player takes a turn in clockwise order and must either
    * add at least one card to the table OR
    * draw a card.
3. All cards on the table must be placed in groups of at least three (3) as either
    * a sequence of cards in the same suit (max size is 14 when Ace to Ace) OR
    * cards of the same value with each suit different (max size is 4).
4. Players can rearrange the cards on the table as long as the placing in point (3) is respected upon rearrangement.
5. The first cards any player lays down at the table must be a "clean" *sequence*, i.e., it cannot contain jokers.
   After that, the player is "unlocked" and can place any number of cards on the table during their turn.
   This results in the start of the game just being many consecutive rounds of drawing for everyone.
6. The first player to have no cards left in their hand wins.
   We usually play until everyone has finished.
   If any player finishes in the same round as the first winner, they share the victory.

*Note:*
My family always plays this game without jokers (even though the game is literally called "Joker" is Slovak).
While this means that the game completely depends on the luck of the draw, we consider this just something to do with our hands while socialising at the table.
