# Hello, World! ☀️

* 🇸🇰 I come from Slovakia, a tiny country in Europe with delicious food.
* 🇳🇱 I've lived in the Netherlands since 2018, when I started my bachelor in Computer Science.
* 👩‍🎓 In 2024, I started pursuing a PhD with [Jesper Cockx](https://jesper.sikanda.be/) at the [Programming Languages](https://pl.ewi.tudelft.nl/) research group.
* 🧬 My research focuses on the usability of interactive theorem provers such as [Agda](https://github.com/agda/agda/).
* 🏢 You can usually find me in office 3.E.220 at [Building 28](https://map.tudelftcampus.nl/nl/poi/wiskunde-informatica-ewi/) at the [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/).

## My Work
  
### [2025] How We Use Interactive Theorem Provers

> **Join an (online) interview to help us determine how we use interactive theorem provers!** <br>
> <br>
> **What?** 90 - 120 minute interviews (possibly including a small think-aloud programming session) <br>
> **When?** interviews will be scheduled starting September 2024 <br>
> **Where?** online (participants from anywhere are welcome) <br>
> **Who?** anyone who uses or has used an interactive theorem prover for whatever purpose <br>
> <br>
> We are hoping these interviews will help us determine how you interact with your theorem provers and to gain insights on how we can improve the user experience.
> We are interested in all aspects of interactive theorem provers, including but not limited to their design, their tooling, their libraries, and their documentation. <br>

### [2024] How Novices Perceive Interactive Theorem Provers
  
> Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are known to have a steep learning curve and poor usability.
> This hinders their spread into commercial software development, wasting their potential to improve software quality.
> To understand what makes them inaccessible to novices, we conducted an online survey among bachelor students, asking them to list the obstacles they encountered while learning Agda.
> Analysis of the results revealed design choices and tool deficiencies which do not provide an adequate level of support to beginner nor advanced users.
> These observations point to one prominent point of improvement: providing a more accessible and sturdy infrastructure for ITP programmers.
